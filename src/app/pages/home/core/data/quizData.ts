    Juggling is a part of my <strong>mind training</strong>. I believe
    that we're often too consumed with our body's appearence, completely
    neglecting brain's fitness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Juggling is a <b>mind's martial art</b>. It teaches you how to deconstruct
    event the most complex challenge into managable pieces and once it's
    done, it develops a <b>habit of winning</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You learn a new trick, then another one, and one more and soon
    you've got dozens of them under your belt and you think you can
    learn anything. It's <b>pretty empowering.</b></p>

    <p>Being exposed, free in a vast open area <b>helps me think</b> and I often come back home with some <b>game-changing ideas</b>. For instance, the idea to use a memory game to introduce myself was a result of such an act.</p>`,

    What the hell is it? A nickname? Here is a story.
      I'm naturally inclined to languages and thus, to stories. One of my personal life challenges is to write a novel.
  </p>
  <p>In the process of learning the writer's craft I've came upon a masterclass by David Baldacci. He mentiones his answer to interviewer's question: when are you going to stop writing? I can't recall his exact words but the idea was that he will never stop and someone will find him dead by the desk. That's first puzzle. </p>
  <p>
    Then comes the second one.
      There's a good movie by Roman Polanski named 'ghostwriter'. That's where I've discovered the word, which in my opinion, is cool.
  </p>
    <p>And then I've daydreamed about my answer to the question given to Baldacci. And here is my answer: "I will write until I'm dead, and once this happens, I will become a ghostwriter in hell". Whether you enjoyed that sentence or not, there is a potential benefit for you in the whole story. Since I'm good at languages, <b>I can succeed with JavaScript or Python</b>, cause after all, they're all languages.</p>`,
